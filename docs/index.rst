Where your code runs - what a "process" is
  Running code in a browser vs. running directly on an OS
Operating system basics
  Processes, file systems, memory, and networks
  A little deeper on networks: DNS, IP addresses, ports &amp; sockets
  IP v4 and IP v6, TCP &amp; UDP, DHCP, ZeroConf/Avahi
  WTF is a 7 layer ISO model anyway, and why do I care?
Physical &amp; virtual devices and IO
  Serial ports, block and character devices, what is POSIX
  USB and Bluetooth
  Specialized hardware (GPUs, Accelerators, etc)
Practicals for working with processes:
  shell scripts and some of Unix CLI concepts
  commands, pipes, STDOUT, STDERR, STDIN
  environment variables, and shell tests
Some basics about how operating systems work:
  Init, systems, hierarchy of processes and how they coordinate
  Kernel vs. user space and permissions, and privileges
  Memory, Buffers, and the various dials that can be tuned (queue theory)
  Sandboxing, background tasks, and scheduling
Another layer of indirection:
  Containers and VMs
  Shared vs emulated resources
  Cloud resources to IoT: you have a budget: CPU, Mem, IO
  Smaller and smaller bits of computation - microprocessors and embedded devices
Physical stuff breaks, all the time
  Redundancy and consistency
  Networks, latency, and information theory
  Why and how these fundamentals expose constraints for development work
