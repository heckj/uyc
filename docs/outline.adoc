= working outline

- Where your code runs - what a "process" is

  - Running code in a browser vs. running directly on an OS

- Platform

 impacts how you see your code running (in a browser, an application on your tablet or phone, on your laptop, or in from a terminal)
  - sometimes this crosses boundaries: e.g. seeing stuff running in a terminal through your browser (you'll see this ALL the time in continuation integration and testing)

  - android, ios - operating system
  - linux, windows - operating system (cloud or physical)
  - browser (chrome, safari, edge)
  - arduino - embedded

- concepts that keep popping up:
  - networking
  - files (block, object) and persistence
  - memory, processes, and threads
  
- Some basics about how operating systems work:
  - Init, systems, hierarchy of processes and how they coordinate
  - Kernel vs. user space and permissions, and privileges
  - Memory, Buffers, and the various dials that can be tuned (queue theory)
  - Sandboxing, background tasks, and scheduling

- Operating system - the next step from the basics
  - networking
    - A little deeper on networks: DNS, IP addresses, ports &amp; sockets
    - IP v4 and IP v6, TCP &amp; UDP, DHCP, ZeroConf/Avahi
    - WTF is a 7 layer ISO model anyway, and why do I care?

- Operating system - the next step from the basics
  - Practicals for working with processes:
    - shell scripts and some of Unix CLI concepts
    - commands, pipes, STDOUT, STDERR, STDIN
    - environment variables, and shell tests

- Operating system - the next step from the basics
  - Devices (physical and virtual) and IO
    - Serial ports, block and character devices, what is POSIX
    - USB and Bluetooth
    - Specialized hardware (GPUs, Accelerators, etc)
      - code within code within code (layers of inception)

- Another layer of indirection:
  - Containers and VMs
  - Shared vs emulated resources
  - Cloud resources to IoT: you have a budget: CPU, Mem, IO
  - Smaller and smaller bits of computation: microprocessors and embedded
    devices

- Physical stuff breaks, all the time
  - Redundancy and consistency
  - Networks, latency, and information theory
  - Why and how these fundamentals expose constraints for development work
